# English to French Translator

Working on deploying a very basic website which uses our api we made using Keras + Flask, to translate english to french.
Visit the [blog post](https://www.avinsharma.com/posts/machine-translation/) to checkout the model that was used for the translation.

The above model is in a sense very poor translator and has an extremely limited vocabulary although we have 98% testing accuracy. This bring to us to future improvements which are, training on a much larger dataset, error handling on the api.
